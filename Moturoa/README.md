rtist statement
_Hardware, software, mixed media. Dimensions variable_
A networked series of interventions in the surrounding environment of Moturoa Stream that senses and monitors change in a range of variables, such as temperature, humidity and conductivity. Together the stations enter a conversation beyond their mere weather-reflective qualities and given structure of land, water and its human and non-human encounter to form a visually engaging addition to the ecosystem in which they are situated. 
Moturoa Transmissions is a wildthings.io project

### Technical description 
The installation featured one Raspberry Pi serving a local WIFi and acting as a MQTT broker.
The nodes consist of Wemos D1 boards connected to the WiFi and monitoring the stream environment through a range of environmental sensors, a mix off-the-shelf shields and DIY sensor solutions.
