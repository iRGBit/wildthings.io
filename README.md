How can artists and designers learn from the more-than-human world when building networked media? This research departed from the concept of an Internet of Things as a means to give voice to non-human ‘things’ and tentatively proposes avenues to shift focus from human-centred to a more-than-human-centred design paradigm. With a focus on wai/water, this project imagines novel ways of understanding and (re-) connecting with disconnected streams, their communities and their ecosystems in Pōneke/Wellington Aotearoa/New Zealand. The research narrative is presented in a combination of written word and audio-visual materials to make the many voices recorded during the lab- and fieldwork heard. The dissertation proposes ways of acknowledging and engaging with local knowledges to inform art and design research.

This repository contains code, sketches, prototypes and designs created during the development of artefacts and artistic outputs of this thesis.
