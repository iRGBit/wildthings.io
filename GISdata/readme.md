# Wellington Addresses who intersect with an original stream

This .csv file was generated by QGIS


I had a vector layer (.gdb) of historical stream data from 1936 and I wanted to know the current addresses where the stream layer crosses a property.

I have downloaded both open property and address datasets (there’s probably a combination of both which would make this much easier) and added them on top of an OSM layer, using QGIS 16.2.3 Mac OSX. 

I used the following datasets:

Streams 1936 .gdb  – blue [thanks WCC]
NZ property titles .shp – teal [thanks LINZ]
NZ street address (2) .shp – green  [thanks again, LINZ]

At this stage this will be a two-step process.
First, identify all properties that overlap with a Stream feature.
Then, identify the address(es) of this properties and export them in a somewhat readable form (.csv). So the feature attribute of nz-street-address-2 that I want for now would be full_add_2. (e.g. 2/11 Arlington Street, Mount Cook, Wellington).
